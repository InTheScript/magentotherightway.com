## Themes

The theme that accompanies your store will invariably be the biggest component of your build and so it's important to build it correctly.

### Blocks

* Develop your blocks in such a way that a future developer can make any modifications required by calling `<action method="name" />` in the `layout.xml`.
* Don't override the `getTemplate()` method, or if you do, `$this->hasData('template')` first.

### Templates

* Ensure your strings are wrapped with `$this->__('')` for translations.
* Add `/** @var $this Mage_Core_Block_Template */` (replacing the correct class name) at the top of your template file -- your IDE will love you.

### Layout Files

* Use `<update handle="" />` to refactor repeated block declarations.
* Move blocks from one reference to another using `<action method="unsetChild"></action>` and `<action method="insert"></action>`.
* Create a `local.xml` in your theme as a place to store all of your theme modifications.  Don't create `catalog.xml`, `customer.xml`, `page.xml`, etc, files unless absolutely necessary.
